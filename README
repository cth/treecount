This is a small program that counts the number of
parses for a sentence given an ambiguous grammar.

To use it modify the grammar in grammar.pl to suit
your needs and then consult treecount.pl from 
SWI Prolog and invoke the main goal count/0.

The grammar technically needs to be Chomsky normal
form, but the program will rewrite your grammar to
a weakly equivalent grammar in CNF is it is not.
Don't worry, the number of parse trees will be 
the same :-)
